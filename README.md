# Superclean

## ðŸ§¼ Introduction (1.0)

Superclean is a minimal, statically typed, interpreted scripting language designed for clarity and ease of implementation.

It uses familiar syntax inspired by C, JavaScript, and Rust, and is implemented in Rust using the `nom` and `rustyline` crates.

This project was developed as part of the course **CS-C2170 â€“ Modern and Emerging Programming Languages** at **Aalto University**.

## âœ¨ Features

- C-like syntax with braces and semicolons
- Static type checking
- Integers, booleans, and strings
- Variable bindings, control flow, and functions
- Interactive REPL and file execution support
- Written in Rust with [`nom`](https://docs.rs/nom) and [`rustyline`](https://docs.rs/rustyline)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Build & Run

To start the REPL:

```bash
cargo run
```

To run a Superclean program from file:

```bash
cargo run -- path/to/file.sclean
```
