if functions have no return type, they return unit.
if else have to have semicolon.
print has semicolon; other function calls dont.
tuples with one element have to have comma. (e.g. (1,) is a tuple, (1) wont work)
tuples are inmutable.
comments at the end of a file break the file.
cant handle whitespace at end of file (main.rs takes care of it, but tests do not)
if if-else doesnt have else, and the condition is false, it returns unit.
BREAK DOESNT WORK!!!! (INFINITE LOOPS ARE VERY VERY POSSIBLE)
return statements in functions have to be at base indentation level. (so not inside a block like an if statement (type checker will complain and i had no time to fix))
